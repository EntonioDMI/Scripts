HOW-TO-USE
================

This repository will contain a bunch of quality scripts, mostly related to Roblox (there won't be any for other games here).
1. The name will match the action; for example, **"universal"** will be versatile for most games and will include standard functions like aimbot, hitbox, and others.

2. I will try to indicate in the script's name whether it **supports Solara Executor**.

3. All the scripts written here will be **personally crafted by me**, which means they will be completely safe to use. I can't be fully certain about detection, but I can guarantee that your account **won't be stolen**. 

## Which injectors were working at the time of testing

Personally, I used the following injectors:

- **JJSploit**: It seemed very fast to me, as it works **without a key**, without those annoying **linkvertise** ads, and is virtually **bug-free**. I'm not sure about **UNC** as I haven't checked, but JJSploit supports slightly more scripts than **Solara Executor**.

- **Solara Executor**: I used it solely for your sake; I didn't need it at all. I only used it when I needed to check script compatibility with it (I did this because many people nowadays prefer to cheat using **Solara Executor**).

- **Celery**: Yes, this injector isn't one of the most well-known, unlike **Wave**, which is trash anyway (no hate, just facts). **Celery** is a level 7 injector, and I also used it solely for script testing—to see if they worked and how to modify them to function on lower levels.

You might ask: Why do I sometimes talk as if I’m rewriting existing scripts rather than writing them myself? Here's my answer: I don’t rewrite scripts; I only **take code snippets** if something isn’t working out for me. So, in a way, you’d be partially right, and you can **feel proud** of yourself!

I think we’ll end it here. I wish you all **good luck avoiding detection**, long account longevity, and a great personal life!
